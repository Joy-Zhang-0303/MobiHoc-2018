            <b>Abstract: </b>Wi-Fi Goes to Town is a Wi-Fi based roadside hotspot network designed to operate at vehicular speeds and picocell (meter-sized) cells. Wi-Fi Goes to Town APs make delivery decisions to the vehicular clients they serve at millisecond-level granularities, exploiting very fine-grained path diversity in roadside networks. In order to accomplish this, we introduce new buffer management algorithms that integrate with 802.11 frame aggregation to allow participating APs to manage each others’ queues, rapidly quenching each others’ transmissions and flushing each others’ queues.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Caching is essential for data-intensive mobile applications to reduce duplicated data transmission. In this paper, we study the optimal probabilistic caching and re-caching policies in mobile networks as the file popularity may change over time. We propose a Probabilistic File Re-caching (PFR) policy to match the updated popularity. Through PFR, files cached (resp. not cached) are probabilistically opted out (resp. opted in). PFR is with substantial advantages: (1) PFR can handle a huge combinatorial number of all possible situations. (2) The expected number of replaced files is minimized. (3) The computational complexity of PFR is low. Second, we study a utility optimization problem in the mobile network, in order to optimally decide the probability that each file is cached and whether a file should be downloaded from a peer device or directly from the server. Even though the optimization problem is non-convex programming in nature, we devise a computationally efficient Optimal Probabilistic Caching and Requesting (OPCR) policy, through decoupling the decision variables, to derive a globally optimal solution. Finally, we develop a real-world prototype and conduct trace-driven simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed PFR and OPCR policies.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Viral marketing through online social networks (OSNs) has aroused great interests in the literature. However, the fundamental problem of how to optimize the “pure gravy” of a marketing strategy through influence propagation in OSNs still remains largely open. In this paper, we consider a practical setting where the “seed nodes” in an OSN can only be probabilistically activated by the product discounts allocated to them, and make the first attempt to seek a discount allocation strategy to maximize the expected difference of profit and cost (i.e., revenue) of the strategy. We show that our problem is much harder than the conventional influence maximization issues investigated by previous work, as it can be formulated as a non-monotone and non-submodular optimization problem. To address our problem, we propose a novel “surrogate optimization” approach as well as two randomized algorithms which can find approximation solutions with constant performance ratios with high probability. We evaluate the performance of our approach using real social networks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms previous work both on the revenue and on the running time.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>This article investigates the basic design principles for a new Wireless Network Operating System (WNOS), a radically different approach to software-defined networking (SDN) for infrastructure-less wireless networks. Departing from well-understood approaches inspired by OpenFlow, WNOS provides the network designer with an abstraction hiding (i) the lower-level details of the wireless protocol stack and (ii) the distributed nature of the network operations. Based on this abstract representation, the WNOS takes network control programs written on a centralized, high-level view of the network and automatically generates distributed cross-layer control programs based on distributed optimization theory that are executed by each individual node on an abstract representation of the radio hardware.<br />
We first discuss the main architectural principles of WNOS. Then, we discuss a new approach to automatically generate solution algorithms for each of the resulting subproblems in an automated fashion. Finally, we illustrate a prototype implementation of WNOS on software-defined radio devices and test its effectiveness by considering specific cross-layer control problems. Experimental results indicate that, based on the automatically generated distributed control programs, WNOS achieves 18%, 56% and 80.4% utility gain in networks with low, medium and high levels of interference; maybe more importantly, we illustrate how the global network behavior can be controlled by modifying a few lines of code on a centralized abstraction.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Network function virtualization (NFV) can significantly reduce the operation cost and speed up the deployment for network services to markets. Under NFV, a network service is composed by a chain of ordered virtual functions, or we call a "network function chain." A fundamental question is when given a number of network function chains, on which servers  should we  place these functions and how  should we form a chain on these functions? This is challenging due to the intricate dependency relationship of functions and the intrinsic complex nature of the optimization. In this paper, we formulate the function placement and chaining problem as an integer optimization, where each variable is an indicator whether one service chain can be deployed on a configuration, and each configuration is one possible function placement and chaining for a service chain. While this problem is generally NP-hard, we show that it can be mapped to an exponential number of min-cost flow problems. Instead of solving all the min-cost problems, one can select a small number of mapped min-cost problems, which are likely to have a low cost. To achieve this,   we relax the integer problem into a fractional linear problem, and theoretically prove that the fractional solutions possess some desirable properties, i.e., the number and the utilization of selected configurations can be upper and lower bounded, respectively. Based on such properties, we determine some "good configurations selected from the fractional solution and determine the mapped min-cost flow problem, and this helps us to develop efficient algorithms for network function placement and chaining. Via extensive simulations, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing heuristic or greedy algorithms and achieve near-optimal performance.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>We develop an auction framework for privacy-preserving data aggregation in mobile crowdsensing, where the platform plays the role as an auctioneer to recruit workers for a sensing task. In this framework, the workers are allowed to report privacy-preserving versions of their data to protect their data privacy; and the platform selects workers based on their sensing capabilities, which aims to address the drawbacks of game-theoretic models that cannot ensure the accuracy level of the aggregated result, due to the existence of multiple Nash Equilibria. Observe that in this auction based framework, there exists externalities among workers’ data privacy, because the data privacy of each worker depends on both her injected noise and the total noise in the aggregated result that is intimately related to which workers are selected to fulfill the task. To achieve a desirable accuracy level of the data aggregation in a cost-effective manner, we explicitly characterize the externalities, i.e., the impact of the noise added by each worker on both the data privacy and the accuracy of the aggregated result. Further, we explore the problem structure, characterize the hidden monotonicity property of the problem, and determine the critical bid of workers, which makes it possible to design a truthful, individually rational and computationally efficient incentive mechanism. The proposed incentive mechanism can recruit a set of workers to approximately minimize the cost of purchasing private sensing data from workers subject to the accuracy requirement of the aggregated result. We validate the proposed scheme through theoretical analysis as well as extensive simulations.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>With the prevalent of smart devices and home automations, voice command has become a popular User Interface (UI) channel in the IoT environment. Although Voice Control System (VCS) has the advantages of great convenience, it is extremely vulnerable to the spoofing attack (e.g., replay attack, hidden/inaudible command attack) due to its broadcast nature. In this study, we present WiVo, a device-free voice liveness detection system based on the prevalent wireless signals generated by IoT devices without any additional devices or sensors carried by the users. The basic motivation of WiVo is to distinguish the authentic voice command from a spoofed one via its corresponding mouth motions, which can be captured and recognized by wireless signals. To achieve this goal, WiVo builds a theoretical model to characterize the correlation between wireless signal dynamics and the user’s voice syllables. WiVo extracts the unique features from both voice and wireless signals, and then calculates the consistency between these different types of signals in order to determine whether the voice command is generated by the authentic user of VCS or an adversary. To evaluate the effectiveness of WiVo, we build a testbed based on Samsung SmartThings framework and include WiVo as a new application, which is expected to significantly enhance the security of the existing VCS. We have evaluated WiVo with 6 participants and different voice commands. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that WiVo achieves the overall 99% detection rate with 1% false accept rate and incurs a low latency overhead.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>With the ubiquitous adoption of smartphones and mobile devices, it is now common practice for one’s location to be sensed, collected and likely shared through social platforms. While such data can be helpful for many applications, users start to be aware of the privacy issue in handling location and trajectory data. While some users may voluntarily share their location information (e.g., for receiving location-based services, or for crowdsourcing systems), their location information may lead to information leaks about the whereabouts of other users, through the co-location of events when two users are at the same location at the same time and other side information, such as upper bounds of movement speed. It is therefore crucial to understand how much information one can derive about other’s positions through the co-location of events and occasional GPS location leaks of some of the users.<br />
In this paper we formulate the problem of inferring locations of mobile agents, present theoretically-proven bounds on the amount of information that could be leaked in this manner, study their geometric nature, and present algorithms matching these bounds. We will show that even if a very weak set of assumptions is made on trajectories’ patterns, and users are not obliged to follow any ‘reasonable’ patterns, one could infer very accurate estimation of users’ locations even if they opt not to share them. Furthermore, this information could be obtained using almost linear-time algorithms, suggesting the practicality of the method even for huge volumes of data.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>We study a privacy-preserving data collection problem, by jointly considering data reporters’ data correlation and social relationship. A data collector gathers data from individuals to perform a certain analysis with a privacy-preserving mechanism. Due to data correlation, the data analysis based on the reported data can cause privacy leakage to other individuals (even if they do not report data). The data reporters will take such a privacy threat into account, owing to the social relationship among individuals. This motivates us to formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game: In Stage I, the data collector selects some individuals as data reporters and designs a privacy-preserving mechanism for a sum query analysis. In Stage II, the selected data reporters contribute their data with possible perturbations (through adding noise). By analyzing the data reporters’ equilibrium decisions in Stage II, we show that given any fixed reporter set, only one data reporter with the most significant joint consideration of the social relationship and data correlation may add noise to his reported data. The rest of the data reporters will truthfully report their data. In Stage I, we derive the data collector’s optimal privacy-preserving mechanism and propose an efficient algorithm to select the data reporters. We conclude that the data collector should jointly capture the impact of data correlation and social relation to ensure all data reporters truthfully reporting their data. We conduct extensive simulations based on random network and real-world social data to investigate the impact of data correlation and social network on the system. We find that the availability of social network information is more critical to the data collector compared with data correlation information.<br />
