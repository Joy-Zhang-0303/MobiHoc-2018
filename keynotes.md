# Program Highlights


### Keynote 1

- [Urs Niesen, Qualcomm-Flarion Inc.](https://sites.google.com/site/uniesen/)

  **"Coded Caching for Content Distribution"**

  *Abstract:*  Caching is an important component of content distribution networks.
  The traditional role of caching is to allow delivery of content to an end user from a nearby cache rather than from a remote server.
  While this approach is optimal for systems with a single cache, recent work in Information Theory shows this to be significantly suboptimal for systems with multiple caches.
  Instead, cache memories should be used to enable coded multicasting opportunities.
  This talk surveys these recent developments.
  We discuss both the fundamental performance limits of cache networks and the practical challenges that need to be overcome in real-life scenarios.


### Keynote 2

- [Karl H. Johansson. KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/)

  **"Waiting for information on this"**


### Keynote 3

- [Kyle Jamieson, Princeton]()

  **"Wi-Fi Goes to Town: Techniques for Rapid Picocell Switching for Extreme Mobility"**

  *Abstract*: Wi-Fi Goes to Town is a Wi-Fi based roadside hotspot network designed to operate at vehicular speeds and picocell (meter-sized) cells.  Wi-Fi Goes to Town APs make delivery decisions to the vehicular clients they serve at millisecond-level granularities, exploiting very fine-grained path diversity in roadside networks.  In order to accomplish this, we introduce new buffer management algorithms that integrate with 802.11 frame aggregation to allow participating APs to manage each others' queues, rapidly quenching each others' transmissions and flushing each others' queues.

  *Bio*: Kyle Jamieson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University and Honorary Reader at University College London.  His research focuses on building mobile and wireless systems for sensing, localization, and communication that cut across the boundaries of digital communications and networking.  He received the B.S. (Mathematics, Computer Science), M.Eng. (Computer Science and Engineering), and Ph.D. (Computer Science, 2008) degrees in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  He then received a Starting Investigator fellowship from the European Research Council, the Google Faculty Research Award, and the ACM SIGMOBILE Early Career (“Rockstar”) Award.
