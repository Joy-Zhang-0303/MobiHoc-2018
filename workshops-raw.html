            <b>Abstract: </b>Today’s modern healthcare delivery systems have been mainly designed to work with the onslaught of an illness, and, logging of information into Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs), related to symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, etc., is initiated with the illness. There is hardly any data collected during the wellness phase of a person. Furthermore, access to the data stored in such systems, for the purpose of analyses, involves complicated manual processes, and the related access policies make it extremely difficult to perform analytics. In this age of wireless sensors, advance networking and data sciences, it is fitting to envision the design of an integrated cyber physical system that allows ubiquitous, but anonymized, collection of wellness and sickness data, and facilitate the development of models and analytics to predict wellnesses and illnesses using vast amounts of data. Towards achieving this vision, we will present a smart healthcare data collection and management environment consisting of a set of intelligent sensor objects, with wireless communication capabilities, installed in clinics, hospital rooms, and mobile platforms, or embedded in human bodies (such as knee transplants or skin patches). We will elaborate on challenges and research opportunities to realize such a system.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Fog computing enables location dependent resource allocation and low latency services, while fostering novel market and business opportunities in the cloud sector. Aligned to this trend, we refer to Fog-to-cloud (F2C) computing system as a new pool of resources, set into a layered and hierarchical model, intended to ease the entire fog and cloud resources management and coordination. The H2020 project mF2C aims at designing, developing and testing a first attempt for a real F2C architecture. This document outlines the architecture and main functionalities of the management framework designed in the mF2C project to coordinate the execution of services in the envisioned set of heterogeneous and distributed resources.

      <b>Abstract: </b>The ability of fine-tuning the performance of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication is essential to create low-power wireless applications with heavy user interaction, such as smart thermostats or door locks. One of the key challenges when designing such applications is finding the right trade-off between a system's responsiveness and energy-efficiency. Although there exists research works that improve the performance of BLE communication, all these approaches focus on connection-based BLE. Most BLE-based applications, however, spend the majority of their time in connection-less device discovery, waiting for approaching users. The energy-efficiency and timeliness in this state are defined by parameters that are often statically set at compile time. Although supported by the BLE specifications, how to dynamically adapt these parameters to user behavior is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and design a strategy to improve the energy-efficiency and responsiveness of BLE device discovery. Towards this goal, we model the device discovery process and identify its key parameters. We further design an adaptive advertising strategy that allows smart objects to adapt their device discovery parameters to the user behavior. We implement this adaptive strategy and measure its performance in a real-world application, the Nuki Smart Door Lock. Our experiments show that a smart lock using our strategy consumes 48% less energy while reducing the device discovery time by up to 63% compared to the use of static parameters. Furthermore, we discuss how nearby BLE devices can be used to inform the lock about approaching user devices and hence to improve its responsiveness in low-power phases even further.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly becoming more common and ownership is set to rise globally in coming years. The potential impacts of increased EVs on the electrical grid have been widely investigated and in its current state, existing grid infrastructure will struggle to meet the high demands at peak charging hours. The limited range of electric cars compounds this issue. We therefore propose CognitiveCharge, a novel approach to predictive and adaptive disconnection aware opportunistic energy discovery and transfer for the smart vehicular charging. CognitiveCharge detects and reacts to individual nodes and network regions which are at risk of getting depleted by using implicit predictive hybrid contact and resources congestion heuristics. CognitiveCharge exploits localised relative utility based approach to adaptively offload the energy from parts of the network with energy surplus to depleting areas with non-uniform depletion rates. We evaluate CognitiveCharge using a multi-day traces for the city of San Francisco, USA and Nottingham, UK to compare against existing infrastructure across a range of metrics. CognitiveCharge successfully eliminates congestion at both ad hoc and infrastructure charging points, reduces the time that a vehicle must wait to charge from the point at which it identifies as being in need of energy, and drastically reduces the total number of nodes in need of energy over the evaluation period.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Connected car technology promises to drastically reduce the num- ber of accidents involving vehicles. However, this technology de- pends on the vehicle precise location to work. The adoption of Global Positioning System (GPS) as a navigation device has limi- tations that compromise geolocation information in certain envi- ronments due to line-of-sight technology. This work introduces the Time Series Dead Reckoning System (TedriS ) as a solution for Dead Reckoning navigation in situations where GPS fails. TedriS is a simple, easy-to-implement and efficient dead reckoning naviga- tion system that uses Time Series Regression Models (TSRM) and the vehicle’s rear wheel speed sensor data from Control Area Net- work (CAN) to estimate its absolute position. The estimate position process is carried out in a training phase and in a predicting phase. In the training phase, a novel technique applies TSRM and stores the relationship between GPS and CAN data that will be used in the predicting phase. TedriS evaluation performance was performed using traces collected in the Campus of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - Brazil and with experiments with a robot carried out at French Research Institute in Computer Science (INRIA) - France. The results show an accuracy compatible with Dead Reckoning navigation state-of-art systems.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Visible light positioning, or VLP, has emerged as a low-cost approach to enabling a variety of indoor location-based services for indoor smart spaces. However, a survey of existing approaches to VLP reveals some challenges to compare one system to the another. Advances in key areas are expected to enable new levels of performance at low cost. These include innovations at the source (LEDs, LDs/LIDAR, and ToF sensors), at the receiver (diversity receivers and AoA sensors), and in the design of the overall end-to-end VLP system. Again, comparing these improvements from one system to the another is difficult due to varying assumptions and operating conditions. In this paper we classify VLP techniques in an attemp to reconcile the wide range of characteristics. We also propose a new concept called an active zone in recognition that best performance is needed primarily in a subset of the volume of an indoor space. Finally, we show the performance of a base VLP system under the new metric and conclude with how our VLP testbed can be used to verify quantify the region we call the {\it active zone}.

      <b>Abstract: </b>We explores the feasibility of using only Bluetooth received signal strength of a smart device to infer user context. Devices that use Bluetooth wireless communication constantly transmit their wireless signal. Adversaries or non-malicious applications can leverage that information to extrapolate the activities in which a user is engaged and the location of certain devices. We explore the accuracy of classification of a range of activities, including walking, typing, writing, and using a mouse. This classification is carried out by simply using the RSSI of a user-worn smart watch.

      <b>Abstract: </b>LoRa and the LoRaWAN specification is a technology for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) designed to allow connectivity for connected objects, such as remote sensors. Several previous works revealed various weaknesses regarding the security of LoRaWAN v1.0 (the official 1st draft) and these led to improvements included in LoRaWAN v1.1, released on Oct 11, 2017. In this work, we provide a first look into the security of LoRaWAN v1.1. We present an overview of the protocol and, importantly, present several threats to this new version of the protocol. Besides, we propose our own ramification strategies for the mentioned threats, to be used in developing next version of LoRaWAN. The threats presented were not previously discussed, they are possible even within the security assumptions of the specification and are relevant for practitioners implementing LoRa-based applications as well researchers and the future evolution of the LoRaWAN specification.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Mobility plays an important role when analysing natural phenomenon. With regard to the electronic engineering and computer science, further understanding of mobility can inspire the better development of artificial systems and intelligent algorithms. In order to intelligently handle mobility, appropriate representation of movement behaviour is essential. As a classical mobility model, the random walk establishes a theoretical basis for analytical study. In literature, the random walk model and its variants have been mathematically analysed. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research has provided a path model for correlated random walks in two-dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, the concept of on-path certainty is proposed to describe movement path and the spatial distribution of on-path certainty is experimentally solved and analysed. As a result, functional relationships of the proposed path model are revealed and discussed for further research.

      <b>Abstract: </b>The transformation of existing power grids into Smart Grids (SGs) aims to facilitate grid energy automation for a better quality of service by providing fault tolerance and integrating renewable energy resources in the power market. This evolution towards a smarter electricity grid requires the ability to transmit in real time a maximum of data on the network usage. A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) distributed across the power grid is a promising solution, given the reduced cost and ease of deployment of such networks. These advantages come up against the unstable radio links and limited resources of WSN. In order to reduce the amount of data sent over the network, and thus reduce energy consumption, data prediction is a potent solution of data reduction. It consists on predicting the values sensed by sensor nodes within certain error threshold, and resides both at the sensors and at the sink. The raw data is sent only if the desired accuracy is not satisfied, thereby reducing data transmission. We focus on time series estimation with Least Mean Square (LMS) for data prediction in WSN, in a Smart Grid context, where several applications with different data types and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements will exist on the same network. LMS proved its simplicity and robustness for a wide variety of applications, but the parameters selection (step size and filter length) can directly affect its global performance, choosing the right ones is then crucial. Having no clear and robust method on how to optimize these parameters for a variety of applications, we propose a modification of the original LMS that consists of training the filter for a certain time with the data itself in order to customize the aforementioned parameters. We consider different types of real data traces for the photo voltaic cells monitoring. Our simulation results provide a better data prediction while minimizing the mean square error compared to an existing solution in literature.

            <b>Abstract: </b><p>Human sensing encompasses a range of sensing tasks including (but not limited to) recognizing gestures and activities of daily living, monitoring vitals, and even identifying mood. It is the key enabler of a countless number of applications in diverse domains, such as health care monitoring, sleep monitoring, fitness tracking, immersive gaming, and elderly care. Due to the innumerable ways in which human sensing can improve the quality and experience of life in today’s smart environments, coupled with the ever improving sensing hardware and novel sensing modalities, human sensing is attracting more and more interest from both academia and industry.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, a new class of human sensing systems has spawned that use WiFi signals to perform human sensing. The fundamental principle that enables human sensing using WiFi signals is that when a user moves in a wireless channel, his/her movements cause the wireless channel metrics (WCMs), such as channel state information, received signal strength, and angle-of-arrival of the signal, to change. The patterns of change in WCMs are unique for different human movements. By learning these patterns of change for any given movement, a WiFi-based human sensing system can recognize that movement.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present our work on recognizing human gestures using WiFi. I will also describe our attempts to address some of the practical challenges facing WiFi based human sensing, such as sensitivity of these systems to positions and orientations of users, and simultaneous movements of multiple users. I will conclude with a discussion about further challenges that need to be addressed before WiFi based human sensing systems can be used in real-world settings.</p>

            <b>Abstract: </b><p>The 4G/5G mobile networked systems are providing "anywhere, anytime" Internet access for billions of users. In the foreseen future, they are also envisioned to serve new applications (virtual/augmented reality, self-driving cars, drones, and more). However, the current systems still rely on the "black-box" operations for the network infrastructure. Consequently, the end devices lack intelligence on the underlying network.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present a data-driven approach to enhancing end intelligence in the 4G/5G systems. I will show how software-hardware cooperation enables fine-grained network data that were not possible in existing solutions. I will next demonstrate how to leverage these data to construct analytics in order to catalyze end intelligence. Last, I will describe how the enhanced end intelligence, in return, helps the 4G/5G infrastructure with more provable reliability and efficiency. These results make a case for the  "Knowledge Plane"  for the next-generation mobile Internet. </p>

      <b>Abstract: </b>A recent trend for many malicious actors, such as: (1) terrorists in Iraq and Syria, (2) lone wolf domestic terrorists, (3) drug cartels, or (4) espionage-minded corporations, has been to use commercialoff- the-shelf (COTS) small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) (i.e., drones) that can circumvent ground-based defenses to attack or spy on targets, to transport contraband, or to steal information. Because of the low cost of COTS sUAS and the prior success of these uses, this trend is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to the need to counter the malicious usage of sUAS (i.e., rogue sUAS). Researchers, the armed forces, and technologists have all proposed disparate solutions to this problem. There are no comprehensive and compact solutions capable of effectively tracking, identifying, and actively neutralizing the threats associated with rogue sUAS. Thus, we have developed a mobile cyber solution, using rigorous penetration testing across the top sUAS COTS vendors. Based on the market share of these top vendors, our approach is applicable to approximately 90% of all COTS sUAS.We demonstrate that hard-topatch vulnerabilities (i.e., vulnerabilities that exist across all the top vendors of sUAS) can be used as back-doors to counter the threat of rouge sUAS. Our solution can be launched from a standard laptop or Android mobile device with an external antenna, and is capable of tracking, identifying, and disrupting all Parrot and 3DR sUAS, as well as almost all DJI sUAS (i.e., renders them incapable of video flight) within a 300-meter radius.

      <b>Abstract: </b>With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor and actuator networks, subsequently referred to as IoT networks (IoTNs), are proliferating at an unprecedented rate in several newfound areas such as smart cities, health care, and transportation, and consequently, securing them is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present several useful insights from an exploratory study of the impacts of network layer attacks on IoTNs. We envision that these insights will guide the design of future frameworks to defend against network layer attacks. We also present a preliminary such framework and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting network layer attacks through experiments on a real IoTN test-bed.

      <b>Abstract: </b>The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies have increased the complexity of systems and also exposed them to additional vulnerabilities. Attack-graphs are graphical representations that provide a complete view of how interdependencies among atomic vulnerabilities may be exploited by an adversary to stitch together an attack that can compromise the system. Their manual construction is tedious, error-prone, and time consuming. This paper presents a model-based Automated Attack- Graph Generator and Visualizer (A2G2V). Given the networked system description (its components, connectivity, services it supports, their vulnerabilities and protections), the attack graph enlists set of all possible sequences in which atomic-level vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise a certain system-level security. The proposed A2G2V tool extends an existing formal methods tool (a model-checker) by integrating with it an architecture description tool, our own code (for parsing counterexamples, encoding those for specification relaxation, iterating till all attack sequences are revealed), and also a graph visualization tool.

          <p>
            <b>Abstract: </b>Cascading power outages can inflict devastating consequences on the economic and operational security of city infrastructure, and can even result in fatalities. Service loss of a single transmission line can cause the subsequent shutdown of topologically neighboring, or electrically dependent, transmission lines as power is rerouted to meet customer demand. When apparent power demand exceeds the carrying capacity of a neighboring transmission line, that line will shut down, and a chain-reaction of propagating transmission line outages will commence, leading to a widespread outage. When a transmission line fails, the downstream network of distribution lines that deliver power to individual homes and businesses will shut down, causing loss of power to critical appliances, such as refrigeration systems, which require constant power to prevent food spoilage. The Great Blackout of 2011 on September 8 affected seven million California residents, and spread into Arizona and parts of Baja California in Mexico. Caused by the unintentional mistake of a single technician who shut down a 500 kV transmission line between the Hassayampa and North Gila substations in Arizona, the outage propagated through five major power grids within 11 minutes, which resulted from the sequential overload of networked transmission lines. The outage cost homeowners and restaurants between $12 and $18 million in damages from the spoilage of perishable food. During the Northeast blackout of 2003, nearly 100 people died, with one death resulting from loss of air conditioning that was required to keep the skin grafts of a burn victim adequately cooled, thereby illustrating the need for Smart Cities to maintain power to critical appliances as load is shed during propagating outages. The Northeast blackout affected 45 million people in the US, 10 million people in Ontario, and was caused by a software error that failed to re-distribute load to other high-capacity transmission lines after a set of 345 kV transmission lines in Walton Hills Ohio ground faulted by sagging into underlying trees. US electricity consumers lose an incredible $79 billion dollars each year from combined power outages, with a single large outage costing in the order of $10 billion dollars. In this talk, we present an LPWAN fog-computing framework called MIST, designed to monitor and measure local consumer power demand and perform real-time load- shedding decisions at the network edge. Should a localized failure occur, the fog network reacts to mitigate failure propagation by shedding load in a structured way to reduce consumer loss by powering off load in priority order. The MIST framework consists of "smart" electrical receptacles with micro controller measurement devices to monitor and predict the transient coverage of a transmission line outage and cooperatively sheds power to halt propagation. MIST receptacles use the LoRa chirp spread spectrum radio modulation technology for LPWAN, which uses the license-free sub-gigahertz (915 MHz in US) band. Current power shedding techniques employed by energy companies do not distinguish among user home appliances, and can result in a total power loss to selected users. The proposed MIST fog- computing architecture will benefit Smart Cities by providing a means by which energy companies can selectively shed power at the very edge of a grid by powering off customer appliances in order of increasing criticality, thereby mitigating the propagation of a failure and reducing consumer costs that result from power loss.
