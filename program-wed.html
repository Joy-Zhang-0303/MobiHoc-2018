            <b>Abstract: </b>Freight transportation is of utmost importance for our society. Road transport accounts for about 26% of all energy consumption and 18% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. Despite this influence, road goods transportation is mainly done by individual long-haulage trucks with no real-time coordination or global optimisation. In this talk, we will discuss how modern information and communication technology supports a cyber-physical transportation system architecture with an integrated logistic system coordinating fleets of trucks travelling together in vehicle platoons. From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks travelling close together can save more than 10% of their fuel consumption. In addition, by automating the driving, it is possible to change driver regulations and save even more costs. Control, communication, and estimation problems on various level of this transportation system will be presented. It will be argued that a system architecture utilising vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication enable robust and safe control of individual trucks as well as optimised vehicle fleet collaborations and new market opportunities. Extensive experiments done on European highways will illustrate system performance and safety requirements. The presentation will be based on joint work over the last ten years with collaborators at KTH and at the truck manufacturer Scania.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Age of information (AoI) is a recently proposed metric for measuring information freshness. AoI measures the time that elapsed since the last received update was generated. We consider the problem of minimizing average and peak AoI in wireless networks under general interference constraints. When fresh information is always available for transmission, we show that a stationary scheduling policy is peak age optimal. We also prove that this policy achieves average age that is within a factor of two of the optimal average age. In the case where fresh information is not always available, and packet/information generation rate has to be controlled along with scheduling links for transmission, we prove an important separation principle: the optimal scheduling policy can be designed assuming fresh information, and independently, the packet generation rate control can be done by ignoring interference. Peak and average AoI for discrete time G/Ber/1 queue is analyzed for the first time, which may be of independent interest.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>We consider the problem of scheduling real-time traffic with hard deadlines in a wireless ad hoc network. In contrast to existing real-time scheduling policies that merely ensure a minimal timely throughput, our design goal is to provide guarantees on both the timely throughput and data freshness in terms of <em>age-of-information</em> (AoI), which is a newly proposed metric that captures the “age” of the most recently received information at the destination of a link. The main idea is to introduce the AoI as one of the driving factors in making scheduling decisions. We first prove that the proposed scheduling policy is feasibility-optimal, i.e., satisfying the per-traffic timely throughput requirement. Then, we derive an upper bound on a considered data freshness metric in terms of AoI, demonstrating that the network-wide data freshness is guaranteed and can be tuned under the proposed scheduling policy. Interestingly, we reveal that the improvement of network data freshness is at the cost of slowing down the convergence of the timely throughput. Extensive simulations are performed to validate our analytical results. Both analytical and simulation results confirm the capability of the proposed scheduling policy to improve the data freshness without sacrificing the feasibility optimality.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>An increasing number of applications that will be supported by next generation wireless networks require packets to arrive before a certain deadline for the system to have the desired performance. While many time-sensitive scheduling protocols have been proposed, few have been experimentally evaluated to establish realistic performance. Furthermore, some of these protocols involve high complexity algorithms that need to be performed on a per-packet basis. Experimental evaluation of these protocols requires a flexible platform that is readily capable of implementing and experimenting with these protocols. We present PULS, a processor-supported ultra low latency scheduling implementation for testing of downlink scheduling protocols with ultra-low latency requirements. Based on our decoupling architecture, programmability of delay sensitive scheduling protocols is done on a host machine, with low latency mechanisms being deployed on hardware. This enables flexible scheduling policies on software and high hardware function re-usability, while meeting the timing requirements of a MAC. We performed extensive tests on the platform to verify the latencies experienced for per packet scheduling, and present results that show packets can be scheduled and transmitted under 1 ms in PULS. Using PULS, we implemented four different scheduling policies and provide detailed performance comparisons under various traffic loads and real-time requirements. We show that in certain scenarios, the optimal policy can maintain a loss ratio of less than 1% for packets with deadlines, while other protocols experience loss ratios of up to 65%.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>In all networks, link or route capacities fluctuate for multiple reasons, e.g., fading and multi-path effects on wireless channels, interference and contending users on a shared medium, varying loads in WAN routers, impedance changes on power-line channels. These fluctuations severely impact packet delays. In this paper, we study delays in time-varying networks. Intuitively, we expect that for a given average service rate, an increased service rate variability yields larger delays. We find that this is not always the case. Using a queuing model that includes time-varying service rates, we show that for certain arrival rates, a queue with larger service rate variance offers smaller average delays than a queue with the same average service rate and lower service rate variance. We also verify these findings on a wireless testbed. We then study the conditions under which using simultaneously two independent paths helps in terms of delays, for example, in hybrid networks where the two paths use different physical layer technologies. We show that using two paths is not always better, in particular for low arrival rates. We also show that the optimal traffic splitting between the two paths depends on the arrival rate.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Loyalty programs are important tools for sharing platforms seeking to grow supply. Online sharing platforms use loyalty programs to heavily subsidize resource providers, encouraging participation and boosting supply. As the sharing economy has evolved and competition has increased, the design of loyalty programs has begun to play a crucial role in the pursuit of maximal revenue. In this paper, we first characterize the optimal loyalty program for a platform with homogeneous users. We then show that optimal revenue in a heterogeneous market can be achieved by a class of multi-threshold loyalty program (MTLP) which admits a simple implementation-friendly structure. We also study the performance of loyalty programs in a setting with two competing sharing platforms, showing that the degree of heterogeneity is a crucial factor for both loyalty programs and pricing strategies. Our results show that sophisticated loyalty programs that reward suppliers via stepwise linear functions outperform simple sign-up bonuses, which give them a one time reward for participating.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Mobile network operators (MNOs) have been offering mobile data plans with different data caps and subscription fees as an effective way of achieving price discrimination and improving revenue over the past decade. Recently, some MNOs are investigating innovative data plans with time flexibility based on the multi-cap scheme. The rollover data plan (allowing the unused data to roll over to the next month) and the credit data plan (allowing users to borrow their data quota from future months) are such innovative data plans with time flexibility (backward and forward). In this paper, we study how the MNO optimizes its multi-cap data plan with time flexibility in the realistic asymmetric information scenario, where each user is associated with multi-dimensional private information, i.e., the data valuation and the network substitutability. Specifically, we consider a multi-dimensional contract-theoretic approach, and analyze the optimal data caps and the subscription fees design systematically. We find that each user’s willingness-to-pay for a particular data cap can be captured by the slope of his indifference curve on the contract plane, and the feasible contract (satisfying the incentive compatibility and individual rationality conditions) will allocate larger data caps for users with higher willingness-to-pay. Furthermore, we conduct a market survey to estimate the statistical distribution of users’ private information, and examine the performance of our proposed multi-dimensional contract design using the empirical data. Numerical results further reveal that the optimal contract may provide price discounts (i.e., negative subscription fees) to attract low valuation users to select a small-cap (possibly zero-cap) contract item. A data mechanism with better time flexibility brings users higher payoffs and the MNO more profit, hence increases the social welfare.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Mobile data crowdsourcing has found a wide range of applications (e.g., spectrum sensing, environmental monitoring) by leveraging the “wisdom” of a potentially large crowd of “workers” (i.e., mobile users). A key metric of crowdsourcing is data accuracy, which relies on the quality of the participating workers’ data (e.g., the probability that the data is equal to the ground truth). However, the data quality of a worker can be its own private information (which the worker learns, e.g., based on its location) that it may have incentive to misreport, which can in turn mislead the crowdsourcing requester about the accuracy of the data. This issue is further complicated by the fact that the worker can also manipulate its effort made in the crowdsourcing task and the data reported to the requester, which can also mislead the requester. In this paper, we devise truthful crowdsourcing mechanisms for Quality, Effort, and Data Elicitation (QEDE), which incentivize strategic workers to truthfully report their private worker quality and data to the requester, and make truthful effort as desired by the requester. The truthful design of the QEDE mechanisms overcomes the lack of ground truth and the coupling in the joint elicitation of worker quality, effort, and data. Under the QEDE mechanisms, we characterize the socially optimal and the requester’s optimal task assignments, and analyze their performance. We show that the requester’s optimal assignment is determined by the largest “virtual valuation” rather than the highest quality among workers, which depends on the worker’s quality and the quality’s distribution. We evaluate the QEDE mechanisms using simulations which demonstrate the truthfulness of the mechanisms and the performance of the optimal task assignments.

      <b>Abstract: </b>We study the problem of learning channel statistics in order to efficiently schedule transmissions in wireless networks subject to interference constraints. In particular, we focus on the primary interference model which requires that at any time the set of activated links be a matching in the corresponding graph. We propose a distributable algorithm that forms greedy matchings in the graph in order to learn the channels’ transmission rates, while simultaneously exploiting previous observations to obtain high throughput. Comparison to the offline solution shows our algorithm to have good performance that scales well with the number of links in the network. We then turn our attention to the stochastic setting where packets randomly arrive to the network and await transmission in queues at the nodes. We develop a queue-length-based scheduling policy that uses the channel learning algorithm as a component. We analyze our method in time varying environments and show that it achieves the same stability region as that of a greedy matching policy with full channel knowledge (i.e., half of the full stability region).<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering a graph that represents the statistical data dependency among nodes for a set of data samples generated by nodes, which provides the basic structure to perform an inference task, such as MAP (maximum a posteriori). This problem is referred to as structure learning. When nodes are spatially separated in different locations, running an inference algorithm requires a non-negligible amount of message passing, incurring some communication cost. We inevitably have the trade-off between the accuracy of structure learning and the cost we need to pay to perform a given message-passing based inference task because the learnt edge structures of data dependency and physical connectivity graph are often highly different. In this paper, we formalize this trade-off in an optimization problem which outputs the data dependency graph that jointly considers learning accuracy and message-passing cost. We focus on a distributed MAP as the target inference task due to its popularity, and consider two different implementations, ASYNC-MAP and SYNC-MAP that have different message-passing mechanisms and thus different cost structures. In ASYNC-MAP, we propose a polynomial time learning algorithm that is optimal, motivated by the problem of finding a maximum weight spanning tree. In SYNC-MAP, we first prove that it is NP-hard and propose a greedy heuristic. For both implementations, we then quantify how the probability that the resulting data graphs from those learning algorithms differ from the ideal data graph decays as the number of data samples grows, using the large deviation principle, where the decaying rate is characterized by some topological structures of both original data dependency and physical connectivity graphs as well as the degree of the trade-off, which provides some guideline on how many samples are necessary to obtain a certain learning accuracy. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulations, which confirm that it has a good match.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>For Internet-based services, users’ quality of service (QoS) depends on not only the available resource (capacity) but also the number of users who use the resource simultaneously (e.g., congestion effect). When a new Internet-based service provider first enters the market, there can be uncertainties regarding both the capacity and congestion, and hence the uncertainty of QoS. In this paper, we consider a participation-dependent social learning over the QoS through users’ online reviews, where the QoS changes with the number of review participants. We study how such a learning process affects the provider’s dynamic pricing strategy. With a simple two-period model, we analyze the strategic interactions between the provider and the users, and characterize the provider’s optimal two-period dynamic pricing policy. Our results show that when the capacity is small or the users’ prior QoS belief is high, the provider will choose a higher introductory price in the first period (than the price in the second period). This is in sharp contrast with the common practice of setting a lower introductory price to attract users (when congestion is not an issue). Furthermore, the learning process is beneficial to the provider with a large capacity.<br />
