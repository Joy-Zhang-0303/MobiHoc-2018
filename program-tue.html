            <b>Abstract: </b>Caching is an important component of content distribution networks. The traditional role of caching is to allow delivery of content to an end user from a nearby cache rather than from a remote server. While this approach is optimal for systems with a single cache, recent work in Information Theory shows this to be significantly suboptimal for systems with multiple caches. Instead, cache memories should be used to enable coded multicasting opportunities. This talk surveys these recent developments. We discuss both the fundamental performance limits of cache networks and the practical challenges that need to be overcome in real-life scenarios.

      <b>Abstract: </b>Thanks to their great success as a green urban transportation means of first/last-mile connectivity, bike sharing service (BSS) networks has been proliferating all over the globe. Their station (re)placement and dock resizing has thus become an increasingly important problem for bike sharing service providers.<br />
In contrast to the use of conventional labor-intensive user surveys, we propose a novel optimization framework called CBikes, (re)configuring the BSS network with crowdsourced station suggestions from online websites. Based on comprehensive real data analyses, we identify and utilize important global trip patterns to (re)configure the BSS network while balancing the local biases of individual feedbacks. Specifically, crowdsourced feedbacks, station usage history, cost and other constraints are fused into a joint optimization of BSS network configuration. We further design a semidefinite programming transformation to solve the bike station (re)placement problem efficiently and effectively. Our evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of CBikes in (re)placing stations and resizing docks based on 3 large BSS systems (with more than 900 stations) in Chicago, Twin Cities, and Los Angeles, as well as related crowdsourced feedbacks.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>With the proliferation of sensor-rich mobile devices, crowd sensing has emerged as a new paradigm of collecting information from the physical world. However, the sensory data provided by the participating workers are usually not reliable. In order to identify truthful values from the crowd sensing data, the topic of truth discovery, whose goal is to estimate each worker’s reliability and infer the underlying truths through weighted data aggregation, is widely studied. Since truth discovery incorporates workers’ reliability into the aggregation procedure, it shows robustness to the data poisoning attacks, which are usually conducted by the malicious workers who aim to degrade the effectiveness of the crowd sensing systems through providing malicious sensory data. However, truth discovery is not perfect in all cases. In this paper, we study how to effectively conduct two types of data poisoning attacks, i.e., the availability attack and the target attack, against a crowd sensing system empowered with the truth discovery mechanism. We develop an optimal attack framework in which the attacker can not only maximize his attack utility but also disguise the introduced malicious workers as normal ones such that they cannot be detected easily. The desirable performance of the proposed framework is verified through extensive experiments conducted on a real-world crowd sensing system.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>With increase in the number of connected wireless devices, simultaneous use of multiple wireless networks has been proposed as a solution to improve throughput and reduce congestion. The autonomous choice of networks by clients leads to a network selection game, where selfish clients strategize to find the best set of providers. In this network selection game, we define client utility as a function of the throughput achieved when the number of such network connections is constrained. The throughput model is based on capacity sharing and incorporates link dependent PHY rates and priority levels of the clients. This paper studies the stability of the network selection game and provides bounds on the inefficiency of such games. We also present results based on simulation studies.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>We demonstrate the feasibility of long lasting underwater networking by proposing the smart exploitation of the energy harvesting capabilities of underwater sensor nodes. We define a data routing framework that allows senders to select the best forwarding relay taking into account both residual energy and foreseeable harvestable energy. Our forwarding method, named HyDRO, for Harvesting-aware Data ROuting, is also configured to consider channel conditions and route-wide residual energy, performing network wide optimization via local information sharing. The performance of our protocol is evaluated via simulations in scenarios modeled to include realistic underwater settings as well as energy harvesting based on recorded traces. HyDRO is compared to state-of-the-art forwarding protocols for underwater networks. Our results show that jointly considering residual and predicted energy availability is key to achieve lower energy consumption and latency, while obtaining much higher packet delivery ratio. Finally, compared to when run in networks without energy harvesters, HyDRO achieves remarkably higher performance, providing a compelling case for energy harvesting-enabled underwater wireless sensor networks.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>When deciding where to place access points in a wireless network, it is useful to model the signal propagation loss between a proposed antenna location and the areas it may cover. The indoor dominant path (IDP) model, introduced by Wölfle et al., is shown in the literature to have good validation and generalization error, is faster to compute than competing methods, and is used in commercial software such as WinProp, iBwave Design, and CellTrace. The previous algorithms known for computing it involved a worst-case exponential-time tree search, with pruning heuristics for speed.<br />
We prove that the IDP model can be reduced to a parametric shortest path computation on a graph derived from the walls in the floorplan. It therefore admits a quasipolynomial-time (i.e., &lt;span class=math inline"&gt;<em>n</em><sup><em>O</em>(log <em>n</em>)</sup>&lt;/span&gt;) algorithm. Moreover, we give a practical approximation algorithm based on running a small constant number of shortest path computations. Its provable worst-case additive error (in dB) can be made arbitrarily small, and is well below 1dB for reasonable choices of parameters. We evaluate this algorithm empirically against the exact IDP model, showing that it consistently beats its theoretical worst-case bounds, solving the model exactly (i.e., no error) in the vast majority of cases.<br />"

      <b>Abstract: </b>In wireless LANs (WLANs), network-wide time and frequency synchronization among user devices is widely regarded as a necessity for uplink MU-MIMO. Therefore, to enable uplink MU-MIMO in 802.11ax, dedicated MAC protocols (e.g., trigger frame and timing advance mechanism) have been proposed to synchronize user devices in the time and frequency domains. Such MAC protocols increase not only network complexity but also communication overhead. In this paper, we show that the time and frequency synchronization among user devices is not a necessity for uplink MU-MIMO. We propose a practical uplink MU-MIMO solution which does not require time and frequency alignments of the signals from user devices. The key component in our solution is a new PHY design for AP’s receiver, which can decode the concurrent signals from multiple asynchronous user devices. We have built a prototype of our uplink MU-MIMO solution on USPR2-GNURadio testbed. Experimental results show that, using the new PHY, an M-antenna AP can successfully decode the concurrent signals from M asynchronous user devices (2 ≤ M ≤ 4).<br />

The key idea is to simultaneously track a mobile device’s position and orientation using intensity measurements from lighting infrastructure, and to adapt client and AP beams to maintain beam alignment, without training overhead or outages in the 60 GHz band. Our implementation on custom dual-band hardware with 2 GHz wide channels and 24-element, electronically steerable phased array antennas shows that SearchLight successfully tracks client mobility and achieves up to 3x throughput gains compared to an in-band training strategy, and eliminates millisecond-scale in-band training epochs.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>60 GHz millimeter-wave WLANs are gaining traction with their ability to provide multi-gigabit per second data rates. In spite of their potential, link outages due to human body blockage remain a challenging outstanding problem. In this work, we propose mmChoir, a novel proactive blockage mitigation technique that utilizes joint transmissions from multiple Access Points (APs) to provide blockage resilience to clients. We derive a new reliability metric based on angular spread of incoming paths to a client and their blockage probabilities. The metric can be used to intelligently select joint transmissions that can provide higher reliability. The reliability metric along with a novel interference estimation model, is used by mmChoir’s scheduler to judiciously schedule joint transmissions, and increase network capacity and reliability. Our testbed and trace-driven simulations show that can outperform existing beamswitching based blockage mitigation scheme with on an average 58% higher network throughput.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Disruptive changes are underway in the automotive industry as large-scale platforms based on vehicular fleets are deployed to deliver ride sharing and delivery services. Such platforms can also be leveraged to deliver wireless connectivity services, e.g., large-scale connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper examines a network architecture based on a mesh of IoT devices, roadside repositories and vehicular mobile gateways – referred to as mesh+vehicular. We propose a system-level model to study its relative merits versus conventional infrastructure-based IoT architectures– referred to as mesh+cellular. The model reflects the salient properties of the architectures including the key interplay among the variability in the network geometries, routing trees, wireless capacity, and eventually IoT queue stability.<br />
The paper provides an initial study of the scaling of the IoT <span><em>sensing capacity</em></span> of the routing trees per repository and base station respectively for the two architectures: i.e., the scaling the maximum common traffic rate the trees’ IoT devices can generate while maintaining the stability of its queues. We then define the <span><em>harvesting capacity</em></span> per mobile gateway and base station in the two architectures, i.e., the average aggregate IoT rate each can extract assuming IoT devices are limited to their sensing capacity in each tree. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that as the spatial density &lt;span class=math inline"&gt;<em>λ</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>&lt;/span&gt; of IoT devices and corresponding density of repositories along roads scale up, the proposed mesh+vehicular architecture has a gain in its harvesting capacity of order at least <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub><em>s</em></sub><sup><em>γ</em>/4</sup></span> where <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> is the wireless path loss exponent. Underlying such gains is a fundamental shift in network geometry and information flows: in mesh+cellular systems IoT data is routed toward cells’ sinks (zero-dimensional objects) while in mesh+vehicular data is routed to road induced cell edges (one-dimensional objects). Detailed system-level simulations validate the obtained scaling results.<br />"

      <b>Abstract: </b>Base station (BS) cooperation has been regarded as an effective solution to improve network coverage and throughput in next-generation wireless systems. However, it also introduces more complicated handoff patterns, which may potentially degrade user performance. In this work, we aim to theoretically quantify users’ handoff performance in disjoint-clustered cooperative wireless networks. It is a challenging task due to spatial randomness of network topologies. We propose a stochastic geometric model on user mobility, and use it to derive a theoretical expression for the handoff rate experienced by an active user with arbitrary movement trajectory. As a study on the application of the handoff rate analysis, we furthermore characterize the average downlink user data rate under a common non-coherent joint-transmission scheme, which is then used to derive a tradeoff between handoff and data rates in a network with an optimal cooperative cluster size. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate our analysis.<br />

      <b>Abstract: </b>Forecasting with high accuracy the volume of data traffic that mobile users will consume is becoming increasingly important for precision traffic engineering, demand-aware network resource allocation, as well as public transportation. Measurements collection in dense urban deployments is however complex and expensive, and the post-processing required to make predictions is highly non-trivial, given the intricate spatio-temporal variability of mobile traffic due to user mobility. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning and propose a Spatio-Temporal neural Network (STN) architecture purposely designed for precise network-wide mobile traffic forecasting. We present a mechanism that fine tunes the STN and enables its operation with only limited ground truth observations. We then introduce a Double STN technique (D-STN), which uniquely combines the STN predictions with historical statistics, thereby making faithful long-term mobile traffic projections. Experiments we conduct with real-world mobile traffic data sets, collected over 60 days in both urban and rural areas, demonstrate that the proposed (D-)STN schemes perform up to 10-hour long predictions with remarkable accuracy, irrespective of the time of day when they are triggered. Specifically, our solutions achieve up to 61% smaller prediction errors as compared to widely used forecasting approaches, while operating with up to 600 times shorter measurement intervals.<br />
