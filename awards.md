      authors: Rajat Talak, Sertac Karaman, and Eytan Modiano (MIT)
      abstract: 'Age of information (AoI) is a recently proposed metric for measuring
        information freshness. AoI measures the time that elapsed since the last received
        update was generated. We consider the problem of minimizing average and peak AoI
        in wireless networks under general interference constraints. When fresh information
        is always available for transmission, we show that a stationary scheduling policy
        is peak age optimal. We also prove that this policy achieves average age that
        is within a factor of two of the optimal average age. In the case where fresh
        information is not always available, and packet/information generation rate has
        to be controlled along with scheduling links for transmission, we prove an important
        separation principle: the optimal scheduling policy can be designed assuming fresh
        information, and independently, the packet generation rate control can be done
        by ignoring interference. Peak and average AoI for discrete time G/Ber/1 queue
        is analyzed for the first time, which may be of independent interest.<br/>'
